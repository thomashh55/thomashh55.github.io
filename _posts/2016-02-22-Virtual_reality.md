Interest in virtual reality technologies and equipment.

<!--excerpt--> 

I long forward to see advancements in virtual reality, which would have many practical uses from games, creativity, social virtual enviroments, 3D video etc. 

So far, there are many famous head-mounted displays like oculus rift, vibe, fove, playstation VR etc. I intend to buy one of them as soon as price lowers. The main downside today apart from the price is requirement of powerfull computer, but that will change in the near future.
