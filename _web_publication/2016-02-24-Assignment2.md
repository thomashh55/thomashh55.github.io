In this assignment, xml document using docbook DTD was created in a way that it would most resemble my bachelor thesis. Several requirements were given according to which proper docbook tags and constructs were applied. Some examples of them are `<itemizedlist>, <xref>, <emphasis>, <indexrerm>, <bibliography>, <chapter>, <appendix>, <table>, <equation>...` There was also added table of prediction results into the xml document in order to have the table requirement completed. Whole xml document was then transformed using xsl templates, which had to be modified in order to achieve closest resemblance with former work. Some adjustments with the title page have been made, in order to organize it in with most resemblance, so for additional sentences some fo:blocks were added in book.titlepage and their placing and borders were properly adjusted. Also xsl templates had to be modified for generation of list of tables and pictures, for correctly displaying some words in slovak, for proper setting of fonts and some details.
